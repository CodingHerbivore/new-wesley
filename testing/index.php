    <h1>Welcome to Wesley United Methodist Church!</h1>
    <p>Dear Friends,<br/>Welcome! On behalf of the people at Wesley, I am happy to share a little about us. We gather by the grace of God who loves us and invites us to reflect the love of Christ in our lives.</p>
 	<img id="pastorLarge" alt="Pastor Ann Bullis" src="/images/wesley-people0004.JPG" />
    <p>It is good to pause and reflect. No matter who we are, where we've been, or where we're going, we face life's complexities. Often we struggle with self-acceptance, the trails of life, and the difficulties of living genuinely.</p>
    <p>At Wesley, we don't pretend to have all the answers, but we join together in humility, seeking spiritual refreshment, giving thanks, and learning to love others through the teachings of scripture and the example of Jesus.</p>
    <p>God has created us for worship. In gratitude we lift our hearts in prayer and listen for the Spirit. I invite you to join us in expressing your heartfelt gratitude, to offer prayers on behalf of our world, and with loving concern lift up your family and friends. This is our worship.</p>
    <p>We are not created as solitary beings, but thrive in community. Our common heritage as part of the human family is our need for grace. God extends the gift of grace to each one of us. I welcome you to share in our journey of faith as we seek to live more gracefully. </p>
    <p>Grace and Peace,<br/>
      Rev. Ann Bullis</p>

      	<h3>A Thought on Pets in Church</h3>
        <strong>By Fred Shaw</strong><br />Methodist Elder in the Ohio Conference, Director of Native American COS, and Shawnee Native
        <p><img src="./images/wesley-pets0001.jpg" alt="One of Wesley UMC's visiting dogs during the pet blessing service" class="frontPageImg"/>One of the threats we face today is that we humans drastically have separated God and God's creation in our minds and practices. We compartmentalize life so that we can manipulate "things" for our own benefit (real and imagined) and ignore the sanctity of their own being. That enables us to believe we can exploit what God has created, that it is less sacred than our desires. That breaks the circle, the balance, of all being. We can take more than we give and feel that we are justified in doing so. Hence, the present practice of focusing upon the bottom line of profit-and-loss rather than maintaining a sustainable balance for the future.</p>
        <p>God&rsquo;s being encompasses all that is and all that is not, which makes all life sacred. The Sacred personified itself in birth in a stable. Jesus spent his vision quest of 40 days among the animals and flora in the wilderness. Jesus' teachings often used the animals and the plants in making his point. The Apostle Paul indicated that all of the creation is waiting for the redemption that is in the Christ.</p>
        <p>Will having pets in worship offset the imbalance of human practice? Should we turn the sanctuary into a barn? Of course not, but neither should we be concerned that God is offended by the presence of any of God's creation in worship. Maybe, just maybe, that small, dependent life that gives another person such unconditional joy and love will remind someone of how undeserving we are of the love of the Sacred, and that all being is sacred because God looked at it and said, &ldquo;It is good.&rdquo;</p>
